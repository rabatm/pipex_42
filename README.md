pipex is a project from Ã‰cole 42 that delves into the intricacies of UNIX mechanisms, specifically the concept of pipes.

## Description
The purpose of this project is to replicate the behavior of the following shell command:

$ < file1 cmd1 | cmd2 > file2

In other words, pipex should execute two commands (cmd1 and cmd2) with input from file1 and direct the output to file2. The program should handle various scenarios, including incorrect commands, file permissions, and more.

## Mandatory Part
To use pipex, follow this format:

$ ./pipex file1 cmd1 cmd2 file2
